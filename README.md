# NextWord-Prediction
The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

- A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
  - Shiny [NextWord App](https://rana-elrobi.shinyapps.io/nextword-predModel/)

- A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.
  - Rpubs [NextWord App ppt]()
